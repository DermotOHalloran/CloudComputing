 Euler Problem 1 Python

for x in range(0,1000):
	if x % 3 = 0 :
			sum = x + sum
	elif x % 5 = 0:
			sum = x + sum

print sum

I started of with the for loop as we are using numbers less than 1000, 
next i used the if statement to test if it was divisible by 3 or 5 and if it was I added it to the sum.

Euler Problem 2 Python

for x in range(0,4000000):
	def fib(n):
	a,b = 1,1
	for i in range(n - 1):
		a,b = b,a+b
		if a % 2 = 0:
			sum = sum + i

print sum

First I defined the range of >4million, next I defined the fibonanci sequence, if the number is even it gets added to the sum.
