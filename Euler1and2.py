##Euler Problem 1 Python

for x in range(0,1000):
	if x % 3 == 0 :
			sum = x + sum
	elif x % 5 == 0:
			sum = x + sum

print sum

#I started of with the for loop as we are using numbers less than 1000, 
#next i used the if statement to test if it was divisible by 3 or 5 and if it was I added it to the sum.*/


#Euler Problem 2 Python

a = 0
b = 1
while a < 4000000
	b = b + a
	a = b

	if a % 2 == 0:
		 sum = sum + a
print sum

#First I defined the first two numbers , next I defined range in a while loop, finally I added the fibonacci sequence where## the next number is the sum of the last two, if the number is even it gets added to the sum.*/
